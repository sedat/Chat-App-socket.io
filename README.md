# Chat-App-socket.io
Made a chat app using Web Sockets.

Special thanks to The Net Ninja for his amazing introductory playlist on Web Sockets.

This repo is a continuation of the course app. Will add different feature in the future. Initial commit includes a new UI, formatted the code and wrote in ES6.
